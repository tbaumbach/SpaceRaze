This page helps new SpaceRaze players getting started.
<P>
<strong>Basics</strong><br>
        To win SpaceRaze you must defeat and drive back all players from other 
        factions.<br>
        To fight other players you need Spaceships.<br>
        To build Spaceships you need Orbital Wharfs and income.<br>
        To build and upgrade Orbital Wharfs you need income.<br>
        To get more income you need to conquer other planets, or persuade them 
        to join you.
      <p><strong>Spaceships and Orbital wharfs</strong><br>
        Spaceships come in four sizes, small, medium, large and huge. Orbital 
        wharfs come in the same four sizes. To build a spaceship of a certain 
        size, the orbital wharf must be of at least the same size. All new orbital 
        wharfs are small, and can be upgraded to larger sizes. 
      <p><strong>Spaceship Battles</strong><br>
Your ships will automatically engage any enemy ships if they encounter them, with one exception: on all planets you can set
the maximum size of ships that your ships will fight on that planet. This is usually set to "Same size". For example: if set to "Same size" and the enemy fleet has bigger ships thay your fleet, your fleet will retreat immediately.
<p>
You ships will not attack neutral ships unless you check the "Attack if neutral" checkbox on a neutral planet.<p>
There is no way to make peace with players of other factions.
<p><strong>Open and closed planets</strong><br>
        A planet can be closed, and then no-one will se what size of ships there 
        are at the planet, nor who owns it. An open planet reveals those things 
        and more. In the map all open planets have a small scarlet cross (<img src="images/scarlet_cross.gif">) after 
        the planet name.<br>
If a player opens one of his planets he gets an income bonus for that planet (usually +2 income).
<p><strong>Conquer other planets</strong><br>
        To conquer any planet you must first destroy or chase away any defending 
        spaceships. When you are the only one left in the system your ships will 
        start to besiege the planet. When the planets resistance reaches zero 
        it will be yours.<br>
You can lower the resistance of a planet by having the following in your besieging fleet: at least one ship with troops,
a general and/or an Interdictor.<br>
You can also bombard a planet but that will also decrease the planets production. Default bombardment level on all planets are set to "none".
<p><strong>Persuade other planets to join you</strong><br>
To persuade another planet you must move your Governor (or another VIP with the diplomat skill) to the planet (not only sit in a spaceship in orbit around the planet...).<br>
Only neutral planets can be persuaded to join you.<br>
To move a Governor to a neutral planet you must first move him to one of your spaceships and move the spaceship to the planet.<br>
        And don't forget to set maximum size to at least "one size smaller" on any planet 
        the Governor travels to! If you don't the governor might very well get involved 
        is a fight and get blown to bits. <br>
It will take an equal number of turns to persuade a planet to join you as the planet has resistance.
      <p><strong>Your Governor</strong><br>
        If your Governor dies, you have lost the game.<br>
        He is killed if the planet he is residing on is conquered by another player 
        or if the ship he is on is destroyed.
<p><strong>Your first turns</strong><br>
The first turn in a new game you usually do three things: <br>
1. Send your Governor to a big neutral planet nearby so that he can persuade it to join you.<br>
2. Build a ship with troops if you don't start with one.<br>
3. Scout nearby closed neutral planets to find undefended or lighty defended planets.
<p> 
If you find any undefended neutral planets besiege them with your troop ship.<br>
Otherwise attack one of the neutral planets guarded with only "small" ships.<p>
Hint: If you want to be certain if you can win a battle against a neutral planet first send in a small 
cheap ship and set attack max size so that it will fight the neutral ships. Even if it is destroyed the exact 
ships of the neutral fleet will be revealed in the battle report. Then you can use the battle simulator to try
out exactly what size of fleet you need to be certain to win against the neutral fleet.<br>
<p><strong>Middle game</strong><br>
        As soon as you can you should upgrade your Orbital Wharf and build medium 
        and large ships. When you have more powerful ships you can attack 
        neutral planets with medium or large ships, or attack enemy players in 
        your vicinity. 
      <p><strong>Late game</strong><br>
        When most neutral planets have been conquered you must, if you have not 
        already, attack the enemy players. Your main battle utits are usually 
        the biggest &quot;large&quot; ship you can build. You can also use long 
        ranged ships to attack behind enemy lines where his defence are weaker.
