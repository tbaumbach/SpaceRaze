<div class=Header>SpaceRaze - In a Nutshell</div>
<div class=TextHead><b>Introduction</b></div>
<div class=TextArea>
SpaceRaze is a turn-based strategy game of intergalactic warfare and conquest. Players try to win control over a quadrant of space, containing several other players and factions.
The players gives their orders independently and a game server updates the game at specified intervals (or when all players are finished), and performs all orders the players have given.
This document contains a brief introduction to the basic mechanics of the game.
</div>

<div class=TextHead><b>Playing the life of a Planetary Governor</b></div>
<div class=TextArea>
In SpaceRaze each player plays the role of a Planetary Governor, who at the start of the game begins with one planet and a few spaceships. The purpose of the game is to achieve domination in the sector, either alone or together with other players in the same faction.
</div>

<div class=TextHead><b>Factions</b></div>
<div class=TextArea>
All players belong to one of three factions of the game. The factions have different strength and have different spaceships at their disposal.<br>
Players belonging to the same faction can not attack or besiege each other.<br>
Players from different factions are always at war with each other.

</div>

<div class=TextHead><b>Planets</b></div>
<div class=TextArea>
In the quadrant where each game unfolds there exists a number of planets (mostly a few dozens). Typically most of the planets are neutral in the beginning of a game. All planets have a Production number, and this number determines the income for each planets each turn. All planets also has a Resistance level, and this determines how difficult a planet is to conquer.<br>
All planets can also build orbital wharfs.

</div>

<div class=TextHead><b>Orbital Wharfs</b></div>
<div class=TextArea>
To build new spaceships you need orbital wharfs. An orbital wharf can build spaceships of the same size at itself or smaller, i.e. a medium sized wharf can build medium or small sized ships. Wharfs of the bigger sizes can choose to build several smaller ships instead of building one big ship. Orbital wharfs can be upgraded maximum one size each turn. 

</div>

<div class=TextHead><b>Space Stations</b></div>
<div class=TextArea>
Another type of orbital structure are Space Stations. Different factions can gain different advantages by building a Space Station at a planet,
such as increased income or tech level, or the ability to move ships further.<br>

</div>

<div class=TextHead><b>Spaceships</b></div>
<div class=TextArea>
The main purpose of spaceships is to fight enemy spaceships and to conquer planets. 
      If at least one ship in a besieging fleet has Troops the planets resistance 
      will decrease with one each turn, and when it reaches zero the planets capitulates. 
      Bombardment can be used to decrease resistance faster, but will lower prodution 
      of the planet as well.<br><br> 
<b>All spaceships has a maximum range:</b><br>
- "long" means it can move between planets connected by red or blue lines in the starmap<br>
- "short" means it can only move between planets connected by red lines in the starmap<br>
- "none"means it cannot move at all from the planet it was built (typically defence forts)<br><br>
</div>

<div class=TextHead><b>Starfighters and Carriers</b></div>
<div class=TextArea>
tarfighter squadrons are a special type of spaceships. Squadrons can be loaded onboard certain capital ships that
have the ability to act as carriers of squadrons. Capital ships cannot attack squadrons with their main arnaments
but have to use their anti-air defence instead.<br>
</div>

<div class=TextHead><b>Very Important Persons</b></div>
<div class=TextArea>
In the game players also control VIPs (Very Important Persons). The most important of these are the Governor (which is You), because if the Governor dies you have lost the game...<br>
Other VIPs include admirals, spies, assassins and expert engineers.
</div>

<div class=TextHead><b>And the winner is...</b></div>
<div class=TextArea>
If a player control at least 60% of the total production in a game the player has won, and if a factions players together control at least 70% of the production the players of that faction wins a cooperative victory.
